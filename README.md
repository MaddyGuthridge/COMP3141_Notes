These are my notes for COMP3141, UNSW's course on *software design and implementation*.

While I've tried my best to make sure they're correct, I can't be certain - take everything with a grain of salt.

## Viewing the notes
I wrote these notes using Obsi

## Table of contents

## What is COMP3141?

- Mathematically-driven programming
- Essentially, how can we use maths (mainly discrete maths) to make our code more reliable
- Thankfully no calculus

### What will we do?

- Programming
- Logical reasoning
- Design
- Testing
- Types and type systems
- [[Haskell]] (some, but you need to do some self-driven learning)

## What is COMP3141 not?

### COMP3141 is not about formal verification

- We cover some stuff
- But not all of it

### COMP3141 is (supposedly) not a Haskell course

- They promise
- We are assured that we won't believe them

### COMP3141 is not an OOP course

- Haskell is not an object-oriented programming language
- More of a focus on correctness over maintainability
