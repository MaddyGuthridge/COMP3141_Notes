These are my notes for COMP3141, UNSW's course on *software design and implementation*.

Unfortunately, I dropped the course, so these only have notes for the first 2-and-a-bit weeks.

## Viewing the notes
I wrote these notes using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which provides many useful features, such as wiki-style links (`[[page name]]`), used to link pages together. You'll get the best experience reading my notes if you use it as your viewer.

## What is COMP3141?

- Mathematically-driven programming
- Essentially, how can we use maths (mainly discrete maths) to make our code more reliable
- Thankfully no calculus

### What will we do?

- Programming
- Logical reasoning
- Design
- Testing
- Types and type systems
- [[Haskell]] (some, but you need to do some self-driven learning)

## What is COMP3141 not?

### COMP3141 is not about formal verification

- We cover some stuff
- But not all of it

### COMP3141 is (supposedly) not a Haskell course

- They promise
- We are assured that we won't believe them

### COMP3141 is not an OOP course

- Haskell is not an object-oriented programming language
- More of a focus on correctness over maintainability
